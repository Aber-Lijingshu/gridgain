 * Security credentials provider for specifying security credentials.

 * <p>
 * For grid node, security credentials provider is specified in
 * {@link GridConfiguration#setSecurityCredentialsProvider(GridSecurityCredentialsProvider)}
 * configuration property. For Java clients, you can provide credentials in
 * {@code GridClientConfiguration.setSecurityCredentialsProvider(...)} method.
 * <p>
 * Getting credentials through {@link GridSecurityCredentialsProvider} abstraction allows
 * users to provide custom implementations for storing user names and passwords in their
 * environment, possibly in encrypted format. GridGain comes with
 * {@link GridSecurityCredentialsBasicProvider} which simply provides
 * the passed in {@code login} and {@code password} when encryption or custom logic is not required.
 * <p>
 * In addition to {@code login} and {@code password}, security credentials allow for
 * specifying {@link GridSecurityCredentials#setUserObject(Object) userObject} as well, which can be used
 * to pass in any additional information required for authentication.
